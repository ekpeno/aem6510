# Roadmap

So far we have ignored output markets in our analysis

--

But firms actually have production costs in addition to abatement costs, and sometimes these costs cannot be disentangled

--

Now we explore models where output and abatement may not be separable

This captures a wider range of potential abatement methods and technologies

---

# The competitive output model

This model is simply an extension of our previous one

For now drop firm-specific subscripts but we assume firms are asymmetric

--

A firm's production technology is given by: 
`$$x = f(l_1,\dots,l_K)$$`
where `\(x\)` is how many units of output are produced using production function `\(f\)` and vector of inputs `\(\{l_1,\dots,l_K\}\)`

---

# The competitive output model


A firm's emission technology is given by: 
`$$e = g(l_1,\dots,l_K)$$`
where `\(e\)` is how many units of emissions resulting from using the vector of inputs `\(\{l_1,\dots,l_K\}\)`

--

Note that the marginal product of `\(l_k\)` for either `\(f\)` or `\(g\)` could be positive, negative, or zero

--

Why?

--

An input that reduces emissions could reduce output, output-enhancing inputs could increase emissions or be emission-neutral

---

# The competitive output model

Next we need the cost functions

--

The cost function `\(C(x,e)\)` is derived from the firm's cost minimization problem

--

We want to minimize the costs of producing a given combination of output `\((x,e)\)`
`$$C(x,e) = \min_{l_1,\dots,l_k} \left\{ \sum_{k=1}^K w_k l_k + \lambda \underbrace{\left[ x - f(l_1,\dots,l_K) \right]}_{\text{x units of output}} + \mu \underbrace{\left[e-g(l_1,\dots,l_K)\right]}_{\text{e units of emissions}} \right\}$$`
where `\(\{w_1,\dots,w_K\}\)` is a vector of input prices


---

# The competitive output model

Let `\(\hat{e}^x\)` be the freely chosen level of emissions at output level `\(x\)`

We need two sets of assumptions to continue

--

## Assumption Set 1 .hi-red[(general case)]

--

1. `\(C(x,e)\)` is twice continuously-differentiable with `\(C_x &gt; 0\)` and for any `\(x\)` there is an emission level `\(\hat{e}^x\)` such that `\(C_e(x,\hat{e}^x) = 0\)`
--

2. `\(C_e(x,\hat{e}^x) &lt; 0 \,\,\, \forall e &lt; \hat{e}^x\)` and `\(C_e(x, \hat{e}^x) \geq 0 \,\,\, \forall e \geq \hat{e}^x\)`
--

3. `\(C_{xe} = C_{ex} &lt; 0 \,\,\, \forall e &lt; \hat{e}^x\)` 
--

4. `\(C_{xx} &gt; 0, C_{ee} &gt; 0, C_{xx}C_{ee} - C_{ex}^2 &gt; 0\)` 

---

# The competitive output model

What do these tell us?

1. MC of production is positive and there is a cost-minimizing emission level `\(\hat{e}^x\)` for all `\(x\)` in the absence of environmental regulation
--

2. MAC is increasing in abating below `\(\hat{e}^x\)`
--

3. MC of production is smaller with higher emissions `\(\leftrightarrow\)` MAC shifts up if output rises
--

4. Production and abatement costs are convex (marginal costs are increasing)

---

# The competitive output model

We can also see that the non-regulated emission level `\(\hat{e}^x\)` rises with `\(x\)` from the `\(C_e(x,\hat{e}^x) = 0\)` assumption

--

Differentiate `\(C_e(x, \hat{e}^x) = 0\)` wrt `\(x\)` to get: `\(C_{ex}(x,\hat{e}^x){dx \over dx} + C_{ee}(x,\hat{e}^x){d\hat{e}^x \over dx} = 0\)`

--

Rearrange to get: `\({d\hat{e}^x \over dx} = - {C_{ex} \over C_{ee}} &gt; 0\)`

---

# The competitive output model

## Assumption Set 2 .hi[(specific case)]

We will be directly linking emissions to output in the .hi[specific case] so we make these assumptions:

- Cost function `\(C(x)\)` is twice continuously-differentiable
--

- `\(C'(x) &gt; 0, C''(x) &gt; 0\)`
--

- Emissions are given by `\(e = \delta(x)\)` where `\(\delta'(x) &gt; 0\)`
--

- In some cases we will assume `\(\delta(x) = \delta \cdot x\)` to simplify

---

# The competitive output model

What do these tell us?

The MAC function is tired directly to the firm's marginal profit

--

If `\(p\)` is the output price of `\(x\)`, profit is:
`$$\Pi = px - c(x)$$`
and if `\(e = \delta x\)` we have that:
`$${d \Pi \over de} = {p - C'(e/\delta) \over \delta}$$`

---

# The competitive output model

At an unregulated optimum it must be that `\(p - C'(x) = 0\)` so `\(p - C'(\hat{e}^x/\delta) = 0\)` defines the unregulated level of emissions

--

For `\(e &lt; \hat{e}^x\)`: `\(p - C'(e/\delta) &gt; 0\)` since `\(\hat{e}^x\)` is privately optimal for the firm

--

Thus `\({d \Pi \over de}\)` is the marginal abatement cost where `\({d \Pi \over de} &gt; 0\)` for `\(e &lt; \hat{e}^x\)`

--

.hi-blue[The MC of abatement is the forgone marginal profits from reducing emissions]

--

We can also see that the MAC is increasing:
`$${d^2 \Pi \over de^2} = {C''(e/\delta) \over \delta^2} \geq 0$$`

---

# The competitive output model

Next we need to model the demand side of the market

--

Let consumer utility be:
`$$U^i = U_i(x_i) + z_i - D_i(E)$$`
where

- `\(x_i\)` is the person's consumption level
- `\(z_i\)` is spending on all other non- `\(x\)` goods
- `\(D_i(E)\)` are damages from aggregate emissions `\(E\)`
- There are `\(i=1,\dots,J\)` consumers

---

# The competitive output model

The consumer has a budget constraint:
`$$y = px_i + z_i$$`
where the price of `\(z_i\)` is normalized to 1, `\(p\)` is the price of `\(x\)` in terms of `\(z\)`

--

Utility maximization gives us that `\(u'_i(x_i) = p\)`

--

This defines the inverse demand for `\(x\)` as: `\(p_i(x_i) = u'_i(x_i)\)`

--

We can then derive gross benefits from consumption: `\(\int_0^{x_i} u'_i(s)ds =  u_i(x_i)\)`

---

# The competitive output model

Next we want to derive .hi-blue[aggregate] market benefits

--

Let `\(X = \sum_{i=1}^I x_i\)` be aggregate consumption,  `\(P(X)\)` be the market inverse demand curve, and `\(D(E)\)` be the aggregate damage curve
- You get `\(P(X)\)` by just horizontally summing `\(p_i(x_i)\)` like we did in previous classes

--

`\(P(X)\)` and `\(D(E)\)` allow us to .hi-blue[fully] characterize benefits and damages to households
  
---

# The competitive output model

Now we have both sides of our model, next we need to define .hi-blue[social welfare] so we can find efficient outcomes

--

Social welfare in the .hi-red[general case] is given by:
`$$W(x_1,\dots,x_J,e_1,\dots,e_J) \equiv \int_0^{X\equiv\sum x_j} P(s)ds - \sum_{j=1}^J C^j(x_j, e_j) - D(E)$$`
where `\(j\)` are specific firms, and household costs and firm revenues cancel out because they are just a transfer from households to firms

Welfare is CS minus total cost, minus damages

---

# The competitive output model

Social welfare in the .hi[specific case] when `\(e_j = \delta_j(x_j)\)` is given by:
`$$W(x_1,\dots,x_J) \equiv \int_0^{X\equiv\sum x_j} P(s)ds - \sum_{j=1}^J C^j(x_j) - D(E)$$`

where `\(E = \sum_{j=1}^J \delta_j(x_j)\)`

--

Now we can derive the efficiency conditions for our model to understand what defines the optimal allocation

---

# The competitive output model: Efficiency

Begin with the .hi-red[general case], the FOCs are defined by:
`$${\partial W\over\partial x_j} = P(X) - C^j_{x_j}(x_j, e_j) = 0\rightarrow P(X) = C^j_{x_j}(x_j, e_j)$$`
where `\({\partial \over \partial x_j} \int_0^{X\equiv\sum x_j} P(s)ds = P(X) {\partial X \over \partial x_j} = P(X)\)` by the fundamental theorem of calculus, 
--
and
--
`$${\partial W\over\partial e_j} = C^j_{e_j}(x_j,e_j) + D'(E) = 0 \rightarrow D'(E) = -C^j_{e_j}(x_j,e_j)$$`

These `\(2J\)` equations give us the solutions `\(x^*_j, e^*_j\)` for `\(j=1,\dots,J\)`

---

# The competitive output model: Efficiency

The conditions are pretty straightforward, right?

--

- `\(P(X) = C^j_{x_j}(x_j, e_j)\)` tells us that marginal benefit of consumption must equal marginal cost of consumption
--

- `\(-C^j_{e_j}(x_j,e_j) = D'(E)\)` tells us that marginal abatement cost must equal marginal damage

--

For efficiency, we need to balance the environmental and production costs of producing the good with the benefits of consuming it

---

# The competitive output model: Efficiency

The .hi[specific case] can give us some more insight

--

Here only the `\(x_j\)`s are choice variables so we get the following FOCs:
`$$P(X) = C'_j(x_j) + D'(E)\delta_j'(x_j) \,\,\,\, j=1,\dots,J$$`

--

The left hand side is the marginal benefit of consumption

--

The right hand side is the total marginal cost:
  - Private production costs
  - External damage costs
  
  
---

.pull-right[
`\(X^c\)` is the competitive allocation, this results in:
   - Too much production
   - Too low of an output price

`\(X^*\)` is the optimal allocation where SMB = SMC
   - This results in less production than the competitive allocation at a higher price

 Where do the aggregate curves come from?
 
 We get aggregate private MC `\(C'(X) = \sum_{j=1}^J C'_j(x_j)\)` by *horizontally* summing firm MCs

]

---

# Policy instruments

Now we will take another look at our environmental policy instruments in this model with output markets

--

We will see that:

--
  - There are additional results related to the output market that we didn't have before
  
--

  - The previous results all still hold: taxes, subsidies, permits can all achieve the efficient allocation
  
---

# Policy instruments: taxes

When facing an emission tax `\(\tau\)` a competitive firm's problem in the .hi-red[general case] is:
`$$\Pi_j(x_j, e_j) = p x_j - C^j(x_j,e_j) - \tau e_j$$`
where `\(p\)` is the market price of `\(x\)`

--

The firm's FOCs are:

--

`\begin{align}
  p &amp;= C'_{x_j}(x_j,e_j) \\
  \tau &amp;= -C'_{e_j}(x_j,e_j)
\end{align}`

---

# Policy instruments: taxes

The firm's FOCs are:
`\begin{align}
  p &amp;= C'_{x_j}(x_j,e_j) \\
  \tau &amp;= -C'_{e_j}(x_j,e_j)
\end{align}`

--

The firm equates MR to MC of production

--

The firm equates the marginal abatement cost to the tax level

--

So if the regulator sets `\(\tau = D'(E^*)\)` .hi-blue[we can achieve the efficient allocation]

---

# Policy instruments: taxes

When facing an emission tax `\(\tau\)` a competitive firm's problem in the .hi[specific case] where `\(e_j = d x_j\)` is:
`$$\Pi_j(x_j) = p x_j - C^j(x_j) - \tau \delta x_j$$`
with FOC:
`$$p = C'_j(x_j) + \tau \delta$$`

--

If the regulator sets `\(\tau = D'(E^*)\)` then firms behave as if
`$$P(X) = C'_j(x_j) + \delta D'(E^*)$$`
.hi-blue[which matches our social efficiency condition]

---

# Comparative statics

Now that we have an output market in our model we can study how taxes influence it

--

To start we will assume all firms are identical and we are in the .hi[specific case] of the model so our profit-maximizing firm FOC is:
`$$P(X) = C'(x) + \delta\tau$$`
where `\(X = x\cdot J\)`

--

Differentiate the FOC with respect to `\(\tau\)` to get how output and emissions respond to a change in the tax rate

---

# Comparative statics

Differentiating gives us:
`$$\left[P'(X)J - C''(x)\right]{dx \over d\tau} = \delta$$`
which implies that:
`$${dx\over d\tau} = {\delta \over P'(X)J - C''(x)} &lt; 0$$`
and `\({dX\over d\tau} = J{dx\over d\tau} &lt; 0\)`  

Emission taxes reduce output

---

# Comparative statics

With `\(E = \delta \cdot X\)` we have how emissions respond to the tax:
`$${dE\over d\tau} = J \delta {\delta \over P'(X)J - C''(x)} &lt; 0$$`
and since `\(p = P(X)\)` is the market price of output, we can determine the relationship between output prices and the tax:
`$${dp\over d\tau} = P'(X){d X \over d\tau} &gt; 0$$`


---

# Comparative statics

Recap: What do the comparative statics tell us?

Output and emissions decline in the tax:
  - A tax on emissions raises the marginal cost of production for firms
    - Supply shifts left
  - Output price `\(p\)` goes up, quantity `\(x\)` goes down
  
---

# Comparative statics

The .hi-blue[incidence] of the tax is also made clear by:
`$${dp\over d\tau} = P'(X){d X \over d\tau} &gt; 0$$`

Incidence is how the tax burden is distributed between consumers and producers

--

The more the price of `\(x\)` increases in response to a tax, the more the consumers pay for `\(x\)` because of `\(\tau\)`, the higher their tax incidence


--

Recall from Econ 101 that it doesn't matter who is taxed, the burden is shared by the consumers and producers


---

# Comparative statics

`$${dp\over d\tau} = P'(X){d X \over d\tau} &gt; 0$$`

If `\(P'(X)\)` is small, demand is .hi-blue[elastic (flat)], and consumers have low incidence because the price they pay does not change much in the tax, firms bear most of the cost of the tax

--

If demand is perfectly elastic `\(P'(X) = 0\)` and there is no associated price increase from a tax increase

---

# Comparative statics

`$${dp\over d\tau} = P'(X){d X \over d\tau} &gt; 0$$`

If `\(P'(X)\)` is large, demand is .hi-blue[inelastic (steep)], and consumers have high incidence because the price they pay for `\(x\)` increases substantially in the tax, firms pass-through most of the tax to consumers

--

If demand is perfectly inelastic, then consumers bear the entire cost of the tax
  
---

# Comparative statics: taxes recap

What did we learn?

Increasing a tax:
1. Decreases firm and aggregate emission levels
2. Decreases firm and aggregate output (even in the general case, see pg 103-104 in the book)
3. Increases output prices

---

# Policy instruments: permits

Now suppose the regulator issues `\(L=E^*\)` permits instead of setting a tax

--

The regulator knows that the permit price `\(\sigma\)` that clears the permit market will be `\(\sigma(L) = \sigma(E^*) = D'(E^*)\)`

--

Similarly, the output price will then be `\(p = P(X^*)\)`

--

The regulator can achieve the first-best efficient outcome

---

# Policy instruments: permits

Auctioned versus freely-distributed permits are equivalent in this model in terms of .hi-blue[efficiency]

--

The permit price in the market under free distribution will match the price that clears the permit auction

--

Output prices will also be the same because all firm and consumer decisions will be identical

--

The one way they will be different is how the .hi-blue[rents (economic profits)] are distributed: who gets the value from the scarcity of permits, the firms or the government?


---

# Distribution of rents in permit markets

]

---

# Relative/intensity standards

A common form of standards is called a .hi-red[relative standard]

--

Relative standards regulate firms based on the concentration of pollution relative to some measurable output

--

A relative standard would look something like:
$$ e/x \leq \alpha$$
or equivalently: `\(e \leq \alpha x\)`
where `\(\alpha\)` is the policy variable

--

Relative standards are often called intensity standards because `\(e/x\)` measures the pollution intensity of output

---

# Relative/intensity standards

Relative standards are only interesting in the .hi-red[general case] of our model, in the .hi[specific case]:
- If `\(\delta &gt; \alpha\)`, the firm has to shut down
- If `\(\delta \leq \alpha\)`, the firm complies with the regulation no matter its actions

--

Assume the regulation is binding in the .hi-red[general case] (i.e. it actually affects firm behavior), then the firm will always set `\(e = \alpha x\)`&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Choosing `\(e\)` strictly less than  `\(\alpha x\)` strictly raises costs and reduces profits.
]

This lets us re-write a firm's profit function as: `\(\Pi(x) = px - C(x, \alpha x)\)`

---

# Relative/intensity standards

`$$\Pi(x) = px - C(x, \alpha x)$$`
--

If the regulation is binding, the firm really is only choosing one variable, `\(x\)`

--

The FOC is:
`$$p = C_x(x,\alpha x) + \alpha C_e(x, \alpha x)$$`

The implicit solution to this, `\(x(\alpha)\)`, is the firms supply function, dependent on the policy `\(\alpha\)`

---

# Relative standards vs quantity standards

Suppose the regulator wants to hit `\(e = \bar{e}\)` and she knows `\(x(\alpha)\)`

All the regulator has to do is set `\(\alpha = \bar{e}/x(\alpha)\)`

--

Now suppose the firm just uses a quantity standard and directly sets `\(e = \bar{e}\)`

--

The firm's profit function is:
`$$\Pi(x,\bar{e}) = px - C(x,\bar{e})$$`
and the firm's supply `\(x(\bar{e})\)` is defined by `\(p = C_x(x,\bar{e})\)`

--

If the regulator chooses `\(\bar{e} = e^*\)` the regulator can achieve the efficient outcome

---

# Relative standards vs quantity standards

Recall the relative standard FOC if we wanted to set `\(e = \bar{e}\)`:
`$$p = C_x(x(\alpha),\bar{e}) + \alpha C_e(x(\alpha), \bar{e})$$`

--

and notice that this means that:
`$$p - \alpha C_e(x(\alpha), \bar{e}) = C_x(x(\alpha), \bar{e}) &gt; p$$`
since `\(-C_e\)` is positive

--

What does this mean?

---

# Relative standards vs quantity standards

This means that:
`$$C_x(x(\alpha), \bar{e}) &gt; C_x(x(\bar{e}), \bar{e})$$`

--

It follows pretty simply that: `\(x(\alpha) &gt; x(\bar{e})\)` and that:
--

- `\(C(x(\alpha), \bar{e}) &gt; C(x(\bar{e}), \bar{e})\)` since `\(C_{xx} &gt; 0\)`
--

- `\(-C_e(x(\alpha), \bar{e}) &gt; -C_e(x(\bar{e}), \bar{e})\)` since `\(C_{ex} &lt; 0\)`

--

.hi-blue[Total cost and marginal production and abatement costs are higher under a relative standard]

---

# Relative standards vs quantity standards

Takeaways:

If a regulator sets an emission goal of `\(\bar{e}\)` for a single firm or `\(J\)` firms, then a relative standard will lead to:
--

- higher output
--

- higher total cost
--

- higher marginal abatement cost relative to a quantity standard

--

Why?

---

# Relative standards vs quantity standards

How can the firm achieve compliance under a relative standard `\((e/x \leq \alpha)\)`?

--

Two ways:

--

1. Decrease emissions `\(e\)`
--

2. Increase output `\(x\)`

--

Relative standards allow the firm to meet the standard *in ways we don't want them to,* so we end up with too much output

This limits us to .hi-blue[second-best] outcomes

---

# Relative standards: optimal policy

If we need to use a relative standard due to political or technical reasons what standard should we set to maximize welfare?

--

The regulator's problem is:
`$$W(\alpha) = \int_{0}^{x(\alpha)} P(t) dt - C(x(\alpha), \alpha x(\alpha)) - D(\alpha x( \alpha))$$`

--

The FOC is:
`$$[P - C_x - \alpha C_e] x'(\alpha) - C_e x - D' \times [x + \alpha x'(\alpha)] = 0$$`
where the term in the first bracket is 0 from the firm's `\(\pi\)`-max FOCs

---

# Relative standards: optimal policy

This gives us that:
`$$- C_e  ={x + \alpha x'(\alpha) \over x } D'$$`

.hi-blue[This is not MAC = MD!]

--

`\(x'(\alpha)\)` tells us how output responds to policy and its sign tells us whether MAC `\(&gt;\)` MD or vice versa

--

Suppose `\(x'(\alpha) &gt; 0\)`, then the second best policy sets MAC `\(&gt;\)` MD:
- The second-best quantity of emissions is lower than the first-best / optimal level that sets MAC = MD


---

# Environmental policy in the long run

So far we have assumed a fixed number of firms `\(J\)`

In the long run, firms may enter or exit the market, and this may affect the efficiency properties of our policies

--

Econ 101 tells us that in perfectly competitive markets:

--

- Firms are identical
--

- Firms enter or exit until profits are driven to zero
--

- Firms produce at minimum average cost
--

- Optimal number of firms is endogenous (usually)

--

We will now look at long run properties of policy with identical firms

---

# Environmental policy in the long run

In the long run, firms have fixed and variable costs:
`\begin{align}
C(x,e) = \begin{cases}
VC(x,e) + F \text{  if  } x,e \neq 0 \\
0  \text{  if  } x,e = 0 
\end{cases} \\
\end{align}`

where `\(F\)` is the fixed cost of entry, and `\(VC\)` denotes variable costs of operation

--

In the long run, social welfare will depend on `\(x,e\)` .hi-blue[and the number of firms] `\(J\)`

---

# Environmental policy in the long run

Social welfare is given by:
`$$W(x,e,J) = \max_{x,e,J} \int_0^{x\cdot J} P(t) dt - J\cdot C(x,e)-D(e\cdot J)$$`

--

The FOCs for a social optimum are:
`\begin{align}
P(X^*) =&amp; C_x(x^*,e^*) \tag{x FOC} \\
D'(E^*) =&amp; -C_e(x^*,e^*) \tag{e FOC} \\
P(X^*)x^* =&amp; C(x^*,e^*) + D'(E^*)e^* \tag{J FOC}
\end{align}`

The last expression is the new one for .hi[long-run efficiency]

---

# Environmental policy in the long run

With some slight rearranging of the `\(J\)` FOC we can get:
`$$P(X^*) = { C(x^*,e^*) + D'(E^*)e^*\over x^*}$$`

What does this say?

--

First, for a small firm: 
--
`\(D'(E^*)e^*\)` is approximately the damage caused by that firm because 
--
for sufficiently small `\(e^*\)`, `\(D'(E^*)\)` will be approximately constant `\((\delta)\)` (by a Taylor expansion argument)


---

# Environmental policy in the long run

With some slight rearranging of the `\(J\)` FOC we can get:
`$$P(X^*) = \underbrace{{C(x^*,e^*) + \delta e^*\over x^*}}_{\text{average social cost}}$$`


This means that it is socially efficient for firms to enter or exit until the price of output (approximately) equals the .hi-blue[average social cost curve]


---

# Standards in the long run

In the short run we had that standards were equivalent to taxes and tradable permits

Is this true in the long run?

--

Suppose the regulator wants to cap total emissions at `\(E^*\)`

--

She sets an emission standard `\(e^* = E^*/J^*\)` for all firms where `\(J^*\)` is the optimal long run number of firms

--

Firms can now only choose `\(x\)` since `\(e\)` is fixed at `\(e^*\)`

---

# Standards in the long run

Firms choose output according to:
`$$p = C_x(x,e^*)$$`

--

In the long run competitive equilibrium we will have `\(\hat{J}\)` firms all producing `\(\hat{x}\)` units of output such that:

--

`\begin{align}
  &amp;P(\hat{x}\hat{J}) = C_x(\hat{x},e^*) \tag{MR = MC}\\
  &amp;P(\hat{x}\hat{J})\hat{x} - C(\hat{x},e^*) = 0 \tag{Zero Profit}
\end{align}`

--

MR = MC, and zero profits are our two equilibrium conditions

--

MR = MC maximizes firm profit, zero profits ensures no change in # of firms

---

# Standards in the long run

Recall that long run efficiency required that:
`$$P(X^*)x^* - C(x^*,e^*) = D'(E^*)e^* &gt; 0$$`

--

so we have that `\(\hat{J} \neq J^*\)` and `\(\hat{x} \neq x^*\)`! What's the intuition?

--

When we impose a standard:

--

1. Firms cut back output
--

2. This raises (short-run) profit above zero
--

3. Firms enter the market until profits go to zero: so `\(\hat{J} &gt; J^*\)` and we will have that `\(\hat{x} &lt; x^*\)`

---

# Standards in the long run

This is important!

--

Conventional wisdom tells us that taxes, permits, and standards can all achieve the efficient outcome

--

This is only true in the short run

--

In the long run: standards do not appropriate the damage to the environment `\(D'(E^*)e^*\)` from firms, so we get .hi-red[excess entry] and standards are no longer first-best

---

# Taxes in the long run

Can taxes achieve the efficient outcome in the long run?

--

Yes and it is pretty easy to see, suppose the regulator sets a tax of:
`$$\tau = D'(E^*)$$`

--

Firm profit is then:
`$$\Pi = px - C(x,e) - \tau e$$`

--

Giving us FOCs:
`$$p = C_x(x^*,e^*) \qquad -C_e(x^*,e^*) = \tau$$`

---

# Taxes in the long run

In the long run firms enter until profits are zero so:
`$$\Pi = P(X^*)x^* - C(x^*,e^*) - \tau e^* = 0$$`
so `\(\tau = D'(E^*)\)` implies that
`$$P(X^*)x^* = C(x^*,e^*) + D'(E^*)e^*$$`

The firm FOCs for production and the entry zero-profit condition map exactly to the social welfare maximizing conditions!

--

The payment of tax rents from the firms to the regulator of `\(\tau e^* = D'(E^*)e^*\)` limits entry and is what makes taxes efficient in the long run

---

# Permits in the long run

Now what about permit systems?

--

Suppose the regulator auctions off `\(L=E^*=e^*J\)` permits and let `\(\sigma\)` be the market-clearing permit price

--

The long run equilibrium is defined by the two firm FOCs and the entry condition:
`\begin{align}
  &amp;P(x^*J) = C_x(x^*,e^*) \\
  &amp;\sigma = -C_e(x^*,e^*) \\
  &amp;P(x^*J)x^* - C(x,e) - \sigma e^* = 0
\end{align}`

---

# Permits in the long run

--

Similar to the short run we will have that `\(\sigma = -C_e(x^*,e^*) = D'(L) = D'(E^*)\)`

--

Thus the three long run efficiency conditions are satisfied again if we auction off the permits:
- MR = MC
- MAC = MD
- P = ASC

--

Now what if we freely distribute permits? What do you think?

--

It seems like it might not be long run efficient: 
--
firms are not paying the environmental rent, so zero profit and P = ASC might not occur

---

# Permits in the long run

Suppose we allocate `\(\bar{e}\)` permits to the .hi-[incumbent] identical firms, profit for the incumbent firms given permits is then:
`$$\Pi = px - C(x,e) - \sigma(e-\bar{e})$$`

--

and profit for any future entrants who were not given an allocation is:
`$$\Pi = px - C(x,e) - \sigma e$$`

What two things do you notice?

--

First, for any given `\(\sigma\)`, entrants and incumbents cannot both have zero profit!

--

Our P = ASC condition can't hold for all firms

---

# Permits in the long run

Our efficiency condition is now .hi-red[new firms enter until profits are zero (P=ASC for entrants)]:
`$$\Pi = px - C(x,e) - \sigma e = 0$$`
so that incumbent firms sustain long run profits of:
`$$\sigma\bar{e}$$`

--

What is this saying?

--

.hi-blue[Operating profits] of any firms in the market are zero, incumbents had long run profits **only** from their initial permit allocation

---

# Permits in the long run

The second thing you should have noticed is that the firm FOCs will be identical to the auctioned permit case, firms face the .hi-blue[exact same] incentives for output and emissions

--

This means that freely allocated permits are also long run efficient

--

This is just an application of the Coase theorem: the initial assignment of property rights to pollute does not matter for efficiency

---

# Subsidies in the long run

Now what about subsidies?

In the short run they are equivalent to taxes, are they still equivalent in the long run?

--

Think about the incentives for entry...

--

Denote the reference level of emissions as `\(\hat{e}\)`, firm profits under a subsidy per unit `\(\xi\)` are:
`$$\Pi = px - C(x,e) - \xi(e-\hat{e})$$`

---

# Subsidies in the long run

For damage efficiency we need to set the subsidy equal to MD: `\(\xi = D'(E^*)\)`

--

In the long run equilibrium, firms enter until profits are zero
`$$\Pi = P(X^*)x^* - C(x^*,e^*) - D'(E^*)(e^*-\hat{e}) = 0$$`

--

which implies that
`$$P(X^*)x^* - C(x^*,e^*) - D'(E^*)e^* = -D'(E^*)\hat{e} &lt; 0$$`

Too many firms have entered!

---

# Subsidies in the long run

Why did too many firms enter? 

--

Payments are available to **all** firms and induces excess market entry

--

Permits do not have these problems because the payment was only to incumbent firms, not entrants

--

Incumbent firms are already in the market: giving them the rents from freely distributed permits does not lead to excess entry
