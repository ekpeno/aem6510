# Roadmap

Previously we assumed output markets were competitive and found that the conditions for efficiency (MAC = MD) still hold

--

But markets are often  .hi-red[not] competitive

--

Will this affect our results?

--

Why might it?

--

Now we have .hi-blue[two] distortions in our market, pollution and market power

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

Suppose we have an industry with a .hi-red[single] firm that generates a local pollutant

--

We will again look at both the general and specific cases of our model

--

Lets begin with the specific case where abatement is only possible through output reductions and $E=\delta X$

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

The monopolist's profit-maximization problem under an emission tax is:
$$\max_{X} \Pi(X) = P(X)X - C(X) - \tau E = P(X)X - C(X) - \tau \delta X$$

--

Where the monopolist now controls $X$: aggregate production

--

The FOC for the problem is:
$$P'(X)X + P(X) = C'(X) + \tau \delta$$
and the profit-maximizing output choice is given by $X^M(\tau)$

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

The FOC for the problem is:
$$P'(X)X + P(X) = C'(X) + \tau \delta$$

This illustrates the monopolists decision rule: MR = MC

--

MR consists of two pieces:

1. $P(X)$: Additional revenue from increased $X$
2. $P'(X)X$: decreases in the price for .hi-blue[inframarginal units] from increased $X$

--

The monopolist now accounts for how increasing production lowers price

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

How does the firm respond to the tax? Differentiate the FOC wrt $\tau$:
$$\left[P''(X^M)X^M+ 2P'(X^M) - C''(X^M)\right]{d X^M \over d \tau} = \delta$$

--

and rearrange:
$${d X^M \over d \tau} = {\delta \over \left[P''(X^M)X^M+ 2P'(X^M) - C''(X^M)\right]}$$

--

What's the sign on this expression? 

--

Let's make two assumptions

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

$${d X^M \over d \tau} = {\delta \over \left[P''(X^M)X^M+ 2P'(X^M) - C''(X^M)\right]}$$

--

Assume the inverse demand function $P(X)$ is decreasing, 
--
and for all $X>0$:
$${P''(X) \over P'(X)}X > -1$$

--

This just comes from the second-order sufficient condition for a maximum being satisfied, it mean inverse demand isn't *too convex*: $P''$ is bounded above

--

It also ensures that ${d X^M \over d \tau} < 0$

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

Now lets look at the regulators problem of maximizing the benefits minus the costs of production, accounting for damages:
$$\max_{X} \int_{0}^XP(t)dt - C(X) - D(\delta X)$$

--

She is maximizing the consumption value minus production and environmental costs

--

The FOC for this problem is:
$$P(X^*) = C'(X^*) + \delta D'(\delta X^*)$$
which doesn't map as nicely to the firm's FOC as in competitive markets

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

Lets re-write the regulator's problem and explicitly include the firm's optimal response to $\tau$:
$$W(\tau) =  \int_{0}^{X^m(\tau)} P(t)dt - C(X^m(\tau)) - D(\delta X^m(\tau))$$

--

Then differentiate with respect to $\tau$ to get:
$$[P(X^m) - C'(X^m) - \delta D'(\delta X^m)] \times {d X^m \over d\tau} = 0$$

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

$$[P(X^m) - C'(X^m) - \delta D'(\delta X^m)] \times {d X^m \over d\tau} = 0$$

Recognize $P(X^m) - C'(X^m) = \tau\delta - P'(X^m)X^M$ from the firm FOC

--

Rearranging gives us that the optimal tax rate is characterized by:
$$\tau = D'(\delta X^m) + {P'(X^m)X^m \over \delta}$$

--

Can we achieve the first-best with this tax?

--

Yes! If we plug it into the firm FOC it is the same as the regulator's welfare-maximizing FOC

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

$$\tau = D'(\delta X^m) + {P'(X^m)X^m \over \delta}$$

What is the intuition behind this expression?

--

First, since $P'(X^m) < 0$, $\tau < D'(\delta X^m)$

--

Why?

--

The monopolist already reduces output to exercise its market power

--

So we don't need as big of a tax, or may even need a .hi-blue[subsidy] if the monopolist was reducing output too much, to achieve the first-best

# Environmental policy under monopoly

In the specific case we could achieve the first-best with just an emission tax and solve two externalities at once

--

Does this hold more generally?

--

The general monopoly problem is:
$$\max_{X,E} \Pi(X,E) = P(X)X - C(X,E) - \tau E$$

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

The FOCs are
$$P'(X)X + P(X) = C_X(X,E) \qquad -C_E(X,E) = \tau$$

The first is just MR = MC of production

The second is the MAC = tax for emissions

--

Recall the regulators solution will look like:
$$P(X^*) = C_X(X^*,E^*) \qquad -C_E(X^*,E^*) = D'(E^*)$$

--

Can the regulator use an emission tax alone to achieve the efficient outcome?

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

The regulator's problem is:
$$W(\tau) = \int_0^{X^m(\tau)}P(t)dt - C(X^m(\tau),E^m(\tau)) - D(E^m(\tau))$$

--

The FOC of this problem is:
$$[P(X^M) - C_X(X^m,E^m)]{dX^m \over d\tau} - [C_E(X^m,E^m) + D'(E^m)]{dE^m \over d\tau} = 0$$

--

To get the .hi-blue[second-best] tax rate, substitute in the conditions from the firm FOCs:
$$P'(X)X + P(X) = C_X(X,E) \qquad -C_E(X,E) = \tau$$

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

This gives us that:
$$\tau = D'(E^m) + P'(X^m)X^m {dX^m/d\tau \over dE^m/d\tau}$$
--

What is the second term?

--

It represents how a change in emissions caused by the tax $\tau$ changes how the monopolist exercises market power

--

$P'(X^m)X^m$ is the market power term in MR, ${dX^m/d\tau \over dE^m/d\tau}$ is the output response to a tax-induced change in emissions

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

The sign of this term depends on ${dX^m/d\tau \over dE^m/d\tau}$, so lets sign the two components

--

We do this by differentiating the firm FOCs wrt $\tau$ and first solving for $dX^m/d\tau$:
$$P'(X)X + P(X) = C_X(X,E) \qquad -C_E(X,E) = \tau$$

--

to give us that (after some algebra and dropping function arguments):
$${dX^m \over d\tau} = { -C_{XE} \over C_{EE}\left[ P''X + 2P' - C_{EE}\left\{ C_{XX}C_{EE}-C^2_{XE} \right\} \right] } < 0$$

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

$${dX^m \over d\tau} = { -C_{XE} \over C_{EE}\left[ P''X + 2P' - C_{EE}\left\{ C_{XX}C_{EE}-C^2_{XE} \right\} \right] } < 0$$


We assumed $-C_{XE}> 0$, strict convexity ensures $C_{EE}, C_{XX}C_{EE}-C^2_{XE} > 0$, and our most recent assumption that demand is not too convex ensures $P''X + 2P' < 0$

--

The numerator is positive, the denominator is negative: output declines as the tax increases

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

For emissions we differentiate the firm FOCs wrt $\tau$ solve for ${dE^m \over d\tau}$:
$${dE^m \over d\tau} = {-1 \over C_{EE}} + { C^2_{XE} \over C^2_{EE}\left[ P''X + 2P' - C_{EE}\left\{ C_{XX}C_{EE}-C^2_{XE} \right\} \right] } < 0$$

--

As before, we assumed:
- $-C_{XE}> 0$
- Strict convexity ensures $C_{EE}, C_{XX}C_{EE}-C^2_{XE} > 0$
- Demand is not too convex assumption ensures $P''X + 2P' < 0$

So both output and emissions decline in the tax rate

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

Can we use the tax alone to achieve the first-best?

--

Substitute in the optimal tax expression $\tau$ into the firm emission FOC and see if it reduces to the conditions for the first-best outcome:

--

$$-C_E(X,E) = D'(E^m) + P'(X^m)X^m {dX^m/d\tau \over dE^m/d\tau}$$

--

The last term doesn't equal zero so this FOC, given the second-best tax, cannot is not equal to the first-best condition

--

.hi-red[The regulator cannot achieve the first-best in the general case with a tax alone]

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

What ended up being the difference between the specific and general case?

--

In the specific case the monopolist only had one degree of freedom, output, and the regulator had one instrument, the tax

--

With one instrument and one degree of freedom the regulator can incentivize the firm to select a specific value of output AND emissions

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

In the general case the monopolist has two degrees of freedom: it can choose output and emissions separately

--

The regulator still has only one instrument

--

You cannot use one instrument to pin down two values (similar to solving one equation for two unknowns)

--

When you have fewer instruments than market distortions you are in a .hi-blue[second-best world]

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

Here's some intuition:

--

Suppose $|P'(X)|$ is large so demand is very inelastic $\rightarrow$ small changes in quantity lead to big changes in price

--

In this case, the market power distortion is a big problem $(P(X^M) >>> C_X(X^M,E^M))$

--

If we tax equal to marginal damage, we will make the market power distortion worse

--

The second term in the tax expression reduces the tax to account for these concerns

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

We can achieve the first-best if we have two instruments to address two distortions

- Use an output subsidy to incentivize the monopolist to produce the efficient level
- Use an emission tax to get the efficient level of emissions

The monopolist's problem is:
$$\Pi(X,E) = [P(X) + \xi]X - C(X,E) - \tau E$$
---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

The FOCs are:
$$P(X) + \xi + P'(X)X = C_X(X,E) \qquad -C_E(X,E) = \tau$$

If we set:
$$\xi = -P'(X^*)X^* \qquad \tau = D'(E^*)$$
the firm FOCs reduce to the regulator's efficiency conditions

--

This is a special case of the *Tinbergen Rule* that says you need as many instruments as distortions to achieve the first-best
