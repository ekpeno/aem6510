# Roadmap

Previously we assumed output markets were competitive and found that the conditions for efficiency (MAC = MD) still hold

--

But markets are often  .hi-red[not] competitive

--

Will this affect our results?

--

Why might it?

--

Now we have .hi-blue[two] distortions in our market, pollution and market power

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

Suppose we have an industry with a .hi-red[single] firm that generates a local pollutant

--

We will again look at both the general and specific cases of our model

--

Lets begin with the specific case where abatement is only possible through output reductions and `\(E=\delta X\)`

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

The monopolist's profit-maximization problem under an emission tax is:
`$$\max_{X} \Pi(X) = P(X)X - C(X) - \tau E = P(X)X - C(X) - \tau \delta X$$`

--

Where the monopolist now controls `\(X\)`: aggregate production

--

The FOC for the problem is:
`$$P'(X)X + P(X) = C'(X) + \tau \delta$$`
and the profit-maximizing output choice is given by `\(X^M(\tau)\)`

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

The FOC for the problem is:
`$$P'(X)X + P(X) = C'(X) + \tau \delta$$`

This illustrates the monopolists decision rule: MR = MC

--

MR consists of two pieces:

1. `\(P(X)\)`: Additional revenue from increased `\(X\)`
2. `\(P'(X)X\)`: decreases in the price for .hi-blue[inframarginal units] from increased `\(X\)`

--

The monopolist now accounts for how increasing production lowers price

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

How does the firm respond to the tax? Differentiate the FOC wrt `\(\tau\)`:
`$$\left[P''(X^M)X^M+ 2P'(X^M) - C''(X^M)\right]{d X^M \over d \tau} = \delta$$`

--

and rearrange:
`$${d X^M \over d \tau} = {\delta \over \left[P''(X^M)X^M+ 2P'(X^M) - C''(X^M)\right]}$$`

--

What's the sign on this expression? 

--

Let's make two assumptions

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

`$${d X^M \over d \tau} = {\delta \over \left[P''(X^M)X^M+ 2P'(X^M) - C''(X^M)\right]}$$`

--

Assume the inverse demand function `\(P(X)\)` is decreasing, 
--
and for all `\(X&gt;0\)`:
`$${P''(X) \over P'(X)}X &gt; -1$$`

--

This just comes from the second-order sufficient condition for a maximum being satisfied, it mean inverse demand isn't *too convex*: `\(P''\)` is bounded above

--

It also ensures that `\({d X^M \over d \tau} &lt; 0\)`

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

Now lets look at the regulators problem of maximizing the benefits minus the costs of production, accounting for damages:
`$$\max_{X} \int_{0}^XP(t)dt - C(X) - D(\delta X)$$`

--

She is maximizing the consumption value minus production and environmental costs

--

The FOC for this problem is:
`$$P(X^*) = C'(X^*) + \delta D'(\delta X^*)$$`
which doesn't map as nicely to the firm's FOC as in competitive markets

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

Lets re-write the regulator's problem and explicitly include the firm's optimal response to `\(\tau\)`:
`$$W(\tau) =  \int_{0}^{X^m(\tau)} P(t)dt - C(X^m(\tau)) - D(\delta X^m(\tau))$$`

--

Then differentiate with respect to `\(\tau\)` to get:
`$$[P(X^m) - C'(X^m) - \delta D'(\delta X^m)] \times {d X^m \over d\tau} = 0$$`

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

`$$[P(X^m) - C'(X^m) - \delta D'(\delta X^m)] \times {d X^m \over d\tau} = 0$$`

Recognize `\(P(X^m) - C'(X^m) = \tau\delta - P'(X^m)X^M\)` from the firm FOC

--

Rearranging gives us that the optimal tax rate is characterized by:
`$$\tau = D'(\delta X^m) + {P'(X^m)X^m \over \delta}$$`

--

Can we achieve the first-best with this tax?

--

Yes! If we plug it into the firm FOC it is the same as the regulator's welfare-maximizing FOC

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

`$$\tau = D'(\delta X^m) + {P'(X^m)X^m \over \delta}$$`

What is the intuition behind this expression?

--

First, since `\(P'(X^m) &lt; 0\)`, `\(\tau &lt; D'(\delta X^m)\)`

--

Why?

--

The monopolist already reduces output to exercise its market power

--

So we don't need as big of a tax, or may even need a .hi-blue[subsidy] if the monopolist was reducing output too much, to achieve the first-best

.pull-right[
Suppose MD and MC are constant for simplicity and we are in the specific case
 
`\(X^m, P^m\)` is the unregulated monopoly allocation

`\(X^{MD}, P^{MD}\)` is the outcome if we set `\(\tau = D'(E^*)\)`

Since `\(X^{MD} &lt; X^m &lt; X^*\)` this clearly .hi-red[reduced welfare]

.pull-right[
We want to shift the marginal cost of the firm so that it intersects MR at `\(X^*\)`, this vertical distance is the optimal tax

MR at `\(X^*\)` is 0, so we want to shift marginal cost down to zero

Our tax is then: `\(0-C_X\)`: we actually .hi-blue[subsidize output]
]

# Environmental policy under monopoly

In the specific case we could achieve the first-best with just an emission tax and solve two externalities at once

--

Does this hold more generally?

--

The general monopoly problem is:
`$$\max_{X,E} \Pi(X,E) = P(X)X - C(X,E) - \tau E$$`

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

The FOCs are
`$$P'(X)X + P(X) = C_X(X,E) \qquad -C_E(X,E) = \tau$$`

The first is just MR = MC of production

The second is the MAC = tax for emissions

--

Recall the regulators solution will look like:
`$$P(X^*) = C_X(X^*,E^*) \qquad -C_E(X^*,E^*) = D'(E^*)$$`

--

Can the regulator use an emission tax alone to achieve the efficient outcome?

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

The regulator's problem is:
`$$W(\tau) = \int_0^{X^m(\tau)}P(t)dt - C(X^m(\tau),E^m(\tau)) - D(E^m(\tau))$$`

--

The FOC of this problem is:
`$$[P(X^M) - C_X(X^m,E^m)]{dX^m \over d\tau} - [C_E(X^m,E^m) + D'(E^m)]{dE^m \over d\tau} = 0$$`

--

To get the .hi-blue[second-best] tax rate, substitute in the conditions from the firm FOCs:
`$$P'(X)X + P(X) = C_X(X,E) \qquad -C_E(X,E) = \tau$$`

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

This gives us that:
`$$\tau = D'(E^m) + P'(X^m)X^m {dX^m/d\tau \over dE^m/d\tau}$$`
--

What is the second term?

--

It represents how a change in emissions caused by the tax `\(\tau\)` changes how the monopolist exercises market power

--

`\(P'(X^m)X^m\)` is the market power term in MR, `\({dX^m/d\tau \over dE^m/d\tau}\)` is the output response to a tax-induced change in emissions

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

The sign of this term depends on `\({dX^m/d\tau \over dE^m/d\tau}\)`, so lets sign the two components

--

We do this by differentiating the firm FOCs wrt `\(\tau\)` and first solving for `\(dX^m/d\tau\)`:
`$$P'(X)X + P(X) = C_X(X,E) \qquad -C_E(X,E) = \tau$$`

--

to give us that (after some algebra and dropping function arguments):
`$${dX^m \over d\tau} = { -C_{XE} \over C_{EE}\left[ P''X + 2P' - C_{EE}\left\{ C_{XX}C_{EE}-C^2_{XE} \right\} \right] } &lt; 0$$`

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

`$${dX^m \over d\tau} = { -C_{XE} \over C_{EE}\left[ P''X + 2P' - C_{EE}\left\{ C_{XX}C_{EE}-C^2_{XE} \right\} \right] } &lt; 0$$`


We assumed `\(-C_{XE}&gt; 0\)`, strict convexity ensures `\(C_{EE}, C_{XX}C_{EE}-C^2_{XE} &gt; 0\)`, and our most recent assumption that demand is not too convex ensures `\(P''X + 2P' &lt; 0\)`

--

The numerator is positive, the denominator is negative: output declines as the tax increases

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

For emissions we differentiate the firm FOCs wrt `\(\tau\)` solve for `\({dE^m \over d\tau}\)`:
`$${dE^m \over d\tau} = {-1 \over C_{EE}} + { C^2_{XE} \over C^2_{EE}\left[ P''X + 2P' - C_{EE}\left\{ C_{XX}C_{EE}-C^2_{XE} \right\} \right] } &lt; 0$$`

--

As before, we assumed:
- `\(-C_{XE}&gt; 0\)`
- Strict convexity ensures `\(C_{EE}, C_{XX}C_{EE}-C^2_{XE} &gt; 0\)`
- Demand is not too convex assumption ensures `\(P''X + 2P' &lt; 0\)`

So both output and emissions decline in the tax rate

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

Can we use the tax alone to achieve the first-best?

--

Substitute in the optimal tax expression `\(\tau\)` into the firm emission FOC and see if it reduces to the conditions for the first-best outcome:

--

`$$-C_E(X,E) = D'(E^m) + P'(X^m)X^m {dX^m/d\tau \over dE^m/d\tau}$$`

--

The last term doesn't equal zero so this FOC, given the second-best tax, cannot is not equal to the first-best condition

--

.hi-red[The regulator cannot achieve the first-best in the general case with a tax alone]

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

What ended up being the difference between the specific and general case?

--

In the specific case the monopolist only had one degree of freedom, output, and the regulator had one instrument, the tax

--

With one instrument and one degree of freedom the regulator can incentivize the firm to select a specific value of output AND emissions

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

In the general case the monopolist has two degrees of freedom: it can choose output and emissions separately

--

The regulator still has only one instrument

--

You cannot use one instrument to pin down two values (similar to solving one equation for two unknowns)

--

When you have fewer instruments than market distortions you are in a .hi-blue[second-best world]

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

Here's some intuition:

--

Suppose `\(|P'(X)|\)` is large so demand is very inelastic `\(\rightarrow\)` small changes in quantity lead to big changes in price

--

In this case, the market power distortion is a big problem `\((P(X^M) &gt;&gt;&gt; C_X(X^M,E^M))\)`

--

If we tax equal to marginal damage, we will make the market power distortion worse

--

The second term in the tax expression reduces the tax to account for these concerns

---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

We can achieve the first-best if we have two instruments to address two distortions

- Use an output subsidy to incentivize the monopolist to produce the efficient level
- Use an emission tax to get the efficient level of emissions

The monopolist's problem is:
`$$\Pi(X,E) = [P(X) + \xi]X - C(X,E) - \tau E$$`
---

# Environmental policy under monopoly

The FOCs are:
`$$P(X) + \xi + P'(X)X = C_X(X,E) \qquad -C_E(X,E) = \tau$$`

If we set:
`$$\xi = -P'(X^*)X^* \qquad \tau = D'(E^*)$$`
the firm FOCs reduce to the regulator's efficiency conditions

--

This is a special case of the *Tinbergen Rule* that says you need as many instruments as distortions to achieve the first-best
