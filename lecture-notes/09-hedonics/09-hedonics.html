# Roadmap

- What can we use to infer the demand for environmental goods?
- What do housing prices tell us?
- When do changes in house prices give us welfare measures

---

# Environmental quantity changes

Last time we learned that we cannot directly compute the welfare consequences of a change in environmental quantities

--

There are no markets for the environmental goods

--

We don't observe the ordinary inverse demand curve

--

We can't compute CS, EV, CV, etc!

---

# Revealed preference approaches

One way to circumvent this problem is to look at private goods that interact with the environmental good

--

If there are changes in the environmental good, holding everything else fixed, that should be reflected in *some way* in changes in the price of the related private good

--

This change in price can tell us something about how people value the change in the environmental good

---

# Revealed preference approaches

There is no market for orcas

--

Suppose there's a massive decline in orcas off the Washington coast, what happens?

--

We will likely see demand for sightseeing tours go down (MB of these tours went down!)

--

This drops the price of tours

--

A non-market good had an effect on a market price

--

What does this price change mean?

---

# Hedonics: Property value models

Common market goods to use for revealed preference valuation are .hi-blue[properties]

--

When people buy a home they are purchasing a bundle of goods:
  - Rooms
  - Bathrooms
  - School quality
  - .hi[Environmental quality]

--

Homes located in pristine areas are likely to be more valuable than identical homes located near toxic facilities

---

# Hedonics: Property value models

Real estate is virtually ideal for measuring environmental changes

--

Real estate markets are often competitive and thick

--

Property purchases are large and consequential: buyers and sellers are likely to be well-informed

--

It is uncontroversial that property values should reflect local attributes

---

# The hedonic model

Property value approaches are often called .hi-blue[hedonics] because they rely on the hedonic model

--

Suppose that we have some quality-differentiated good (i.e. a home)

--

This good is characterized by a set of `\(J\)` property characteristics `\(x\)`
  - parcel size, school quality, bedrooms, etc
  
--

It is also characterized by an environmental good `\(q\)`


---

# The hedonic model

The price of a house is determined by a .hi[hedonic price function] `\(P(x,q)\)`


--

`\(P\)` maps characteristics of the house and local environment to the market value of the home

--

For a particular house `\(k\)` its price is `\(p_k = P(x_k,q_k)\)`

--

`\(P\)` arises in equilibrium from the interaction of all buyers in sellers in the market

--

Here we will assume the supply of houses is fixed in the short run so the price function arises from buyer behavior


---

# The hedonic model: consumer's choice problem

Households buy a single property given their budget constraint and their preferences

--

Here we will assume that households are effectively just choosing `\((x,q)\)` instead of a specific house with the following objective:
`$$\max_{x,q,z} U(x,q,z;s) \,\,\,\,\, s.t. \,\,\,\,\, y = z + P(x,q)$$`

--

- `\(z\)` is the numeraire good (spending on other private goods)
- `\(y\)` is income
- `\(s\)` is the set of the household's characteristics like family size


---

# Unrealistic pieces of the model

One unrealistic part of this model is that we are assuming household characteristics are continuous

--

Many housing characteristics are discrete (bedrooms, bathrooms, etc)

--

Another is that you just can't purchase some sets of `\(x\)` (i.e. a huge lot in downtown manhattan with a farm)

--

We won't touch on this in class but there is a .hi-blue[discrete choice] literature that works to alleviate these issues


---

# Choosing q

Another thing to note: the consumer *chooses* `\(q\)` where as before it was fixed

--

The idea is that mobile households can move to get their desired level of the environmental good

--

We are thus also implicitly assuming `\(q\)` varies across space so that households can sort into areas they prefer
  - q is really picking up .hi[local] environmental goods
  

---

# What is `\(P(x,q)\)`

In the model we are thinking of `\(P(x,q)\)` as the annual .hi-blue[rental rate], not the purchase price

--

This allows us to mesh more cleanly with annual income and view the problem as static rather than dynamic

--

This clearly works well for renting households

--

For homeowners we are basically assuming they rent from themselves every year

---

# The hedonic model: consumer's choice problem

`$$\max_{x,q,z} U(x,q,z;s) \,\,\,\,\, s.t. \,\,\,\,\, y = z + P(x,q)$$`

The FOCs for this problem are:
`\begin{align}
  {\partial U \over \partial x_j} =&amp; \lambda {\partial P \over \partial x_j} \,\,\, j=1,\dots,J \\
  {\partial U \over \partial q} =&amp; \lambda {\partial P \over \partial q} \\
  {\partial U \over \partial z} =&amp; \lambda 
\end{align}`

Next, combine the last two FOCs

---

# The hedonic model: consumer's choice problem

`\begin{align}
  {\partial U \over \partial q} =&amp; \lambda {\partial P \over \partial q} \\
  {\partial U \over \partial z} =&amp; \lambda 
\end{align}`
gives us that
`$${\partial P \over \partial q} = {\partial U \over \partial q} \bigg/ {\partial U \over \partial z}$$`

At a utility-maximizing choice, a household equates their MRS between `\(q\)` and `\(z\)` and the marginal implicit cost of `\(q\)`


---

# The hedonic model: consumer's choice problem

`$${\partial P \over \partial q} = {\partial U \over \partial q} \bigg/ {\partial U \over \partial z}$$`

Recall that `\(z\)` is the numeraire good so we can think of it in terms of dollars

--

This means that `\({\partial U \over \partial q} \big/ {\partial U \over \partial z}\)` is the WTP for `\(q\)`, the reduction in income needed to compensate for an additional unit of `\(q\)`

--

Knowledge of the hedonic price function `\(P\)` is enough to tell us about household WTP for `\(q\)`!


---

# The hedonic model: bid functions

Now let's dive deeper by looking at some reference utility level `\(\bar{u}\)`:
`$$U(x,q,z;s) = \bar{u}$$`

--

Next we will define something called a .hi-blue[bid function] `\(b(x,q,y,s,\bar{u})\)` where:
`$$U(x,q,y -b(x,q,y,s,\bar{u}) ;s) = \bar{u}$$`

The bid function `\(b\)` is the maximum amount the household is willing to pay for:  
- A house with characteristics `\(x,q\)`
- Given income `\(y\)` and household characteristics `\(s\)`
- Holding utility fixed

---

# The hedonic model: bid functions

`$$U(x,q,z;s) = \bar{u}$$`

We can also invert this to solve for `\(z\)`:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
`$$z = U^{-1}(x,q,\bar{u},s)$$`

.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; We can do this because `\(U\)` is monotonically increasing in `\(z\)`
]

--

Income, the bid function and `\(z\)` are related by:
`$$b(x,q,y,s,\bar{u}) ;s) = y - U^{-1}(x,q,\bar{u},s)$$`

--

Now we have everything we need to derive a marginal WTP function for `\(q\)`

---

# The hedonic model: deriving MWTP

`$$U(x,q,y -b(x,q,y,s,\bar{u}) ;s) = \bar{u}$$`

Differentiate with respect to `\(q\)` to get:
`$${\partial U \over \partial q} + {\partial U \over \partial z} {\partial b \over \partial q} = 0$$`

--

We can then rearrange to get:
`$${\partial b \over \partial q}  = {\partial U \over \partial q}\bigg/{\partial U \over \partial z}$$`



---

# The hedonic model: deriving MWTP

Recall that the bid function is separable in income: `\(b(x,q,y,s,\bar{u}) ;s) = y - U^{-1}(x,q,\bar{u},s)\)`

--

This lets us re-write `\({\partial b \over \partial q}\)` as:
`$$\pi^q(x,q,s,\bar{u}) = {\partial b \over \partial q}  = {\partial U \over \partial q}\bigg/{\partial U \over \partial z}$$`

--

Conditional on `\(x\)`, this defines our .hi-blue[compensated inverse demand function] for `\(q\)`!

---

# The hedonic model: deriving MWTP

`$$\pi^q(x,q,s,\bar{u}) = {\partial b \over \partial q}  = {\partial U \over \partial q}\bigg/{\partial U \over \partial z}$$`

By assuming `\(q\)` is a part of a larger bundle of house characteristics, we are able to characterize its demand through its relationship to the housing market

--

We can then use the bid function (which maps into prices) to understand the marginal WTP for `\(q\)`

--

Our ultimate empirical goal is to estimate `\(\pi^q(x,q,s,\bar{u})\)`

# Bid functions and housing prices



.pull-left[

The red line is the hedonic price function

The blue lines are a single household's bid functions at different reference utility levels where `\(u_1 &gt; u_0 &gt; u_2\)`

Higher utility `\(\rightarrow\)` lower bids because same level of `\(q\)` can be achieved with higher `\(z\)`

# Bid functions and housing prices

.pull-left[

Optimal choice is where the household's bid function is tangent to the hedonic price schedule: `\(a\)`

This gives us an observed consumption level `\(q_0\)`, observed price `\(P(x,q_0)\)`, and realized utility `\(u^0\)`

# Compensated MWTP



.pull-left[

This plot shows the corresponding compensated MWTP curve associated with `\(b(x,q,y,s,u^0)\)`

It is the slope of the bid function as `\(q\)` changes

We observe `\(b\)` if we can estimate `\(P(x,q)\)` and its derivative

# Compensated MWTP

.pull-left[

We can estimate `\(P(x,q)\)` using home sales prices and home attributes data

The slope of `\(P(x,q)\)` is then equal to the MWTP for `\(q\)`

This gives us the consumers inverse demand for `\(q\)`

`$${\partial P(x,q_0) \over \partial q} = \pi^q(x,q_0,s,u^0)$$`
